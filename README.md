# D&D Characters managers

Welcome adventurers! This is a tool for tracking characters for your personal games,
your orginization's parties and for sharing your ideas for character builds and stories.

It is a MERN project, using React-Typescript, an Express server hosted in HEROKU (soon to migrate to a different host).
The server sends requests to a MongoDB server, and the official D&D api documentation.
